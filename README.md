# What is a LED?
LED stands for Light Emitting Diode, and it's a semiconductor device that emits light when
an electric current passes through it.

## Tutorial 1: Make an LED blink
1 ) Materials:
   
- 1x LED
- 2 Female/Male Jumpers
- 1x Resistor 100 ohn
- Breadboard
- Raspberry Pi
- Micro SD Card
  
2 ) Building the Circuit:

_Step 1:_ 
Connect one of the female/male jumper to the GND pin
 
_Step 2:_
Connect another female/male jumper to the GPIO 17 pin

_Step 3:_ 
Connect the GND jumper to the negative row of the breadboard (Right Side)

_Step 4:_
Connect the GPIO 17 jumper to the positive row of the breadboard (Right Side)

_Step 5:_
Grab your LED and connect it to the negative row and the other leg to the 25 column (Right side)

_Step 6:_
Grab your resistor and connect it to the positive row and the 25 column (Right Side)


Now you're ready to code!
