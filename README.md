# What is a LED?
LED stands for Light Emitting Diode, and it's a semiconductor device that emits light when
an electric current passes through it.

## Tutorial 1: Make an LED blink
1 ) Materials:
   
- 1x LED
- 2 Female/Male Jumpers
- 1x Resistor 100 ohn
- Breadboard
- Raspberry Pi
- Micro SD Card
  
2 ) Building the Circuit:

Step 1: 
 Connect one of the female/male jumper to the GND pin
 
Step 2:
 Connect another female/male jumper to the GPIO 17 pin

Step 3:
 Connect the GND jumper to the negative row of the breadboard (Right Side)

Step 4:
 Connect the GPIO 17 jumper to the positive row of the breadboard (Right Side)

Step 5:
 Grab your LED and connect it to the negative row and the other leg to the 25 column (Right side)

Step 6:
 Grab your resistor and connect it to the positive row and the 25 column (Right Side)


Now you're ready to code!
